</h2>
<p>Welcome to the RICT user guide. Here we explain how to upload
macro-invertebrate results to <a href="https://rictapplications.shinyapps.io/rictapp/" class="external-link">RICT website</a>.
We then demonstrate how to predict reference values for indices and taxa
lists. Additionally, we explain how to classify status and compare
results.</p>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quick-start"></a>
</h2>
<p>Before you start, you need river macro-invertebrate data to process.
If you do not have any data prepared, example data is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/aquaMetrics/rict/raw/master/inst/extdat/input-file-template.xls" class="external-link">validation
template spreadsheet</a>. However, if you are looking to run your own
results, you will need the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>WHPT (Walley, Hawkes, Paisley and Trigg) scores based on
macro-invertebrate results. To calculate WHPT index scores, you can use
the <a href="https://www.fba.org.uk/s/WHPT-calculator-v38.xlsx" class="external-link">WHPT
spreadsheet calculator</a>. Your scores should be based on
macro-invertebrate results collected and analysed following <a href="#sampling">standard techniques</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of predictor values based on field observations and GIS.

</h2>
<p>RICT uses a model based on data collected from sampling locations
with minimal environmental pressures to predict expected conditions
across the river network. UK environment agencies use RICT to classify
rivers for Water Framework Directive (WFD) assessment, and to enforce
statutory objectives.</p>
<p>Key Functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict reference indices values.</li>
<li>Predict reference taxa.</li>
<li>Classify the status of observed results compared to expected
reference conditions.</li>
<li>Give a probability of status class.</li>
<li>Compare two samples and give a likelihood of whether they are
significantly different.</li>
</ul>
<p>RICT is maintained by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment Agency (EA)</li>
<li>Natural Resources Wales (NRW)</li>
<li>Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)</li>
<li>Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: The latest release of RICT replaces the version hosted on Azure
ML Studio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="usage">Usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#usage"></a>
</h2>
<p>RICT is only suitable for freshwater (not estuarine or marine) sites
on rivers or streams that are naturally permanently flowing, and flow
down to the sea (not pumped).</p>
<p>For the official status classification, you must only classify sites
that have invertebrate data from both spring and autumn of the same
year. You can only perform a WFD macro-invertebrate classification using
individual spring and autumn values of WHPT ASPT and WHPT NTaxa (based
on abundance-related index values for all families at Taxon Level 2).
The official method statement for the river invertebrate (general
degradation) classification is available from <a href="http://www.wfduk.org/resources/rivers-invertebrates-general-degradation" class="external-link">WFD
UKTAG</a>.</p>
<p>The probabilities of class provided by RICT are only appropriate for
samples analysed in the laboratory and expressed in the correct form of
WHPT to which the bias values relate.</p>
<p>RICT classifications cannot be used for official purposes if based on
single seasons, different forms of WHPT indices or samples not analysed
in the laboratory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sampling">Sampling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling"></a>

<p>Collect and analyse all samples for RICT according to standard
methods. These two Environment Agency documents provide a current

<p>RICT uses environmental predictors to model expected reference

InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System). It is based on
TWINSPAN grouping.</p>
<p>More information about the specification of the models can be found

<p>There are two models available:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Model 1 (with IoM, GB and NI variations)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Based on a range of observed as well as physical/chemical predictors

model, and this is still the definitive version, used for WFD river
invertebrate status classification and objectives setting.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Model 44 (GB only)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Based on GIS (geology, catchment size etc) and Alkalinity predictors

<p>General guidance on available data sources and use of predictor
variables is outlined in sections below. More information regarding the
units and exact definition of the input predictor variables for all
models can be found in the <a href="https://aquametrics.github.io/rict/articles/user-guide.html">functional

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="model-1-predictors">Model 1 Predictors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-1-predictors"></a>
</h4>
<p>River substrate, width and depth predictors required for GB and NI
variations of Model 1 must be the median long-term averages that take
account of conditions throughout the whole year, including summer.
Preferably they are based on annual averages collected from many years.
As a minimum, these averages should be based on data collected in all
three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) from at least one normal year
(not a year with drought or floods).</p>
<p>If you are unable to get such data, do not use actual measurements of
width and depth when you collected an invertebrate sample, particularly
in summer, but use your estimate what you think the normal width and
depth should be and allow for greater imprecision in RIVPACS
predictions.</p>
<p>Environmental data from Environment Agency monitoring sites suitable
for input into RICT are available from the Ecology &amp; Fish Data
Explorer <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/ecology-fish/" class="external-link uri">https://environment.data.gov.uk/ecology-fish/</a>. This

<h3 id="grid-reference">Grid Reference<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grid-reference"></a>
</h3>
<p>RICT uses 10-figure grid references. The 4th and 5th digits are often
inaccurate unless based on GPS. Grid references are a common cause of <a href="#grid-reference-errors">data input errors</a>.</p>
<p>The GB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid" class="external-link">Ordnance
Survey grid references</a> starts with two letters. Where in as Northern
Ireland, starts with one letter based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_grid_reference_system" class="external-link">Irish
Grid Reference System</a>) These letters represent a unique 100 km
square. These are followed by eastings and northings that locate the
southwest (bottom left) corner of the grid square but describe the whole
grid square, something that is often forgotten. The size of the grid
square is indicated by the number of digits in the easting and northing.
Each successive pair of easting and northing refers to a smaller grid
within the square indicated by the previous easting and northing, so the
100 m square ST3605 is roughly in the middle of the 1 km square
ST30.</p>

</h3>
<p>RICT provides predicted indices outputs for a range of purposes.
Primarily, ‘WHPT NTAXA Abund’ and ‘WHPT ASPT Abund’ reference condition
values are predicted and compared against observed values in the <a href="#classification">Classification</a> process. However, selecting
the ‘All indices’ option will predict indices for a range of other
possible ecological insights.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="indices-usage">Indices Usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#indices-usage"></a>
</h4>
<p>Indices simplify complex biological results to help ecologists
explain them to managers. Although their format is intentionally very
simple (usually a single number or letter), they are actually very
complex, and most do not behave as parameters on a continuous scale. Do
not use indices as a basis for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Users should be wary of using indices, particularly without
understanding the extent of the data from which they were derived
(comprehensiveness, reliability, geographical and stream type coverage),
the statistical properties of their format (average, score, percentage),
the impact of sampling and analytical error on the index and the
magnitude of that error, the way in which the environmental pressure
that the index is designed to respond affects invertebrates, other
environmental pressures that have the same effect, cause the same
environmental pressures or interact with each other (for example,
reducing the availability of oxygen, increasing siltation, altering the
availability of metal ions or nutrients), and other environmental
pressures that co-occur at sites where the pressure of interest
occurs.</p>
<p>The fact that an index sensitive to a particular pressure indicates
an impact does not necessarily mean that pressure is present at a
site.</p>
<p>Invertebrates respond to the integrated effect of all environmental
pressures (both natural and anthropogenic), and it is impossible to
apportion impact to individual pressures unless an environmental
pressure is so severe that it is overwhelming. This will increasingly be
the case as gross pressures are eliminated by environmental
regulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="included-indices">Included Indices<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#included-indices"></a>
</h4>
<p>You should not regard the inclusion of an index in the RICT ‘all
indices’ output as an endorsement of that index. Some indices have been
included to allow them to be evaluated or compared to other indices.
Similarly, the exclusion of an index does not imply that it is not
useful.</p>

<p>Predict the families and species expected at a site and their
abundances. This powerful feature of the RIVPACS model enables the
prediction of a wide range of outputs, helping with investigations and
furthering our ecological understanding.</p>
<p>Predict five taxa lists (TL) at various levels of taxonomic
resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>TL1 - Super-Family</li>
<li>TL2 - Super and Family level (used for routine WFD
classification)</li>
<li>TL3 - Family</li>
<li>TL4 - Mainly species level</li>
<li>TL5 - Family / Species level</li>
</ul>
<p>Find more information about the taxa lists and their taxonomies in <a href="https://www.fba.org.uk/s/WFD100-FINAL-Report.pdf" class="external-link">WFD100
report</a>.</p>
<p>The website restricts the number of sites to no more than 24 sites
due to the large amount of processing and output generated for each
site. Taxa prediction may take several minutes to run depending on the
number of sites and taxa lists required.</p>
<p>If you select ‘Prediction Only’ then classification is not run,
therefore you do not need to include biological data in the input
file.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="taxon-prediction-output">Taxon Prediction Output<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#taxon-prediction-output"></a>
</h4>
<p>The results from the taxon taxa predictions include Maitland and
Furse taxonomic codes, some of which have leading zeroes. It you open
the CSV output file with Excel in the normal way, you will lose these
leading zeroes because Excel will assume that they are numbers. To
preserve the leading zeroes when you open the results in Excel, you will
need to open a blank Excel worksheet and import the results as text.</p>

<p>In the output, each row includes prediction results for one taxon.
For each site, expect about 3500 rows of data if predicting all taxa
lists. The first block of rows will be for the first site selected and
below it the results for the second site. For each site, rows are
ordered by taxonomic level, then by season code, and then by Maitland
code, so you should re-order the data if you only want data for a
particular season but want that for all taxonomic levels.</p>
<p>Each row includes the following columns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>The most important columns from the Classification output are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Class</em> – the WFD status.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Probability of class</em> – certainty of classification,
taking account of uncertainty caused by sampling and other
errors.</p></li>
<li><p>ProbH, ProbG, ProbM, ProbP, ProbB – indicates other likely
classes and whether your site is at the upper, mid or lower end of the

<li><p><em>EQR</em> – Ecological Quality Ratio; The value of a biotic
index expressed as a proportion of its reference value. The reference

<p>A comparison of the EQRs for different indices and seasons can help
you to identify the environmental cause of poor quality.</p>

<p>This option undertakes status classifications for spring and autumn
for a single year. There is no difference in classification results if
you run one years’ spring and summer data using the single year or the
multi-year option. However, there is a slight difference in the headers
in the output file.</p>
<p>Single-year option also calculates single season classifications.
Single season classification are intended only for investigative work.
They are unsuitable for setting environmental quality objectives or
testing compliance against them.</p>
<p>If you do not enter results for a season(s), RICT will leave the
outputs for any missing season(s) empty.</p>

<p>The multi-year option combines data from spring and autumn from one
or more years into a single classification for the site. There is no
limit to the number of years’ data that can be combined. Therefore, the
multi-year option only gives output for the combined years, not for each
individual year.</p>
<p>There is a slight difference in the headers in the multi-year
classification output file compared to single year, as shown in the
Section Description of RICT classification output. There is no
difference in classification results if you run one years’ spring and
summer data using the single year or the multi-year experiment.</p>
<p>There are slight differences in the way that RICT estimates the
probabilities of class for multi-year classifications compared to
previous versions of RICT.</p>
<p>The current RICT bases this on the proportion of all simulated
multi-year average EQR values falling in each status class, whereas RICT
1.0 used an estimate of the “typical” (i.e., average) between-year
variance within a 3-year period for the observed values of a WHPT index
to allow for 1 or 2 years missing data. Neither is philosophically
correct, as explained <a href="#development-history">Development
History</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="probabilities-of-class">Probabilities of class<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#probabilities-of-class"></a>
</h3>
<p>Probabilities of class indicate the likelihood of your site belonging
to each of the WFD status classes. Every site must belong to one of the
5-classes, so for any combination of index and season(s), the
probabilities always add-up to 100%. These estimates take account of
<strong>two types of classification error</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The fact that when the EQR is at exactly the class boundary, the
maximum likelihood of being in either of the classes immediately above
or below that boundary is only 50%.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertainty caused by sampling error (measured in a number of
studies in which the same site was sampled by different people at the
same time) and laboratory error (from the bias value that you enter with
your biological data).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The probabilities are based on the frequency if each class being
indicated by the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Each simulation
includes a random component with the same distribution as the known bias
and sampling error. Remember that other sources of error mentioned in
this section, which cannot be qualified, will also contribute to the
imprecision of the classification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="minta-minimum-of-ntaxa-and-aspt">MINTA (Minimum of NTaxa and ASPT)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#minta-minimum-of-ntaxa-and-aspt"></a>
</h3>
<p>The official Water Framework Directive (WFD) status classification is
based on data (Environmental Quality Ratios) for both WHPT ASPT and WHPT
NTaxa from both spring and autumn. Data from both seasons is combined by
taking an average of the EQRs before determining the status
classification. The status classification from both indices is combined
by taking the worst class indicated by the two indices. MINTA is not
determined from the most probable classes for each index, but by the
combination of the probabilities of class for each index.</p>
<p>Understanding how the probabilities of class are determined for MINTA
is often misunderstood, particularly as the outcome is sometimes
counter-intuitive and has caused users, including the author, to assume
that there has been a mistake. MINTA probabilities of class are not
calculated from the distribution of probabilities of the individual
indices.</p>
<p>They are calculated separately, in exactly the same way as the
probabilities of class for the individual indices, by going back to the
results of each of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The MINTA
probabilities are based on the worst class indicated by either ASPT or
NTaxa in each of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.</p>
<p>The number of simulations in which the worst of these classes was
High, Good, Moderate, Poor or Bad are summed and expressed as
percentages of the 10,000 simulations. This is the same process used to
determine the probabilities of class for the individual indices, but
this time, for each simulation RICT only considers the class indicated
by the index that indicated the worst class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="interpreting-classification-output">Interpreting Classification Output<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interpreting-classification-output"></a>
</h3>
<p>Classification is based on both your observed data and RIVPACS
prediction, so you must consider imprecision in both of these when
interpreting classification results. You must take account of the
reliability of the predictions, see Section Interpreting RICT2
prediction output.</p>
<p>Always check the suitability code from the prediction results, which
is based on the combination of environmental input variables and how
closely they match any of the RIVPACS end groups. Suitability is quite
different to the probability of class, which does not take suitability
into account.</p>
<p>You should also consider any environmental parameters that exceed
warning limit values when judging the reliability of the predictions and
therefore of the classification. Another factor is the quality of the
input data: whether the environmental data is based on true long-term
averages or an estimate base on biologist’s expert opinion.</p>
<p>For classification, the quality of the observed biological data is
also important. This is partly reflected in the bias value, which
represents a component of sorting and data handling error. You should
also consider whether the biologist collecting the samples collected
them correctly, or experienced anything that made sampling difficult,
such as high or low flow, poor access to the site, damaged nets,
declining light or turbid water, which should be recorded with the
sample data. Always consider the probabilities of class and do not base
management decisions solely on the face value or most probable
class.</p>
<p>A site with an objective quality of Good that is classed as Moderate
is less likely to have failed that standard if it also has a reasonably
high probability of being good or better, and may not have actually
failed the standard, whereas a site classed as Moderate but with high
probabilities of being Poor or Bad is more likely to have failed the
standard and the need for management action is much more certain.
Remember that probabilities do not always behave intuitively, as shown
in the explanation of MINTA in the preceding Section.</p>
<p>Two examples below illustrate how the result can be
counter-intuitive:</p>
<p>Site A The most probable class of both ASPT and NTaxa are the same,
Good, but MINTA indicated Moderate. Many of the simulations in which the
worst class was indicated as Moderate by ASPT were different to the
simulations where this was the worst class indicated as Moderate by
NTaxa. As a result, when the number of simulations in which Moderate was
indicated by ASPT and by NTaxa were added together, it came to a greater
number than for each individual index, hence Moderate was the most
probable MINTA class even though the most probable class for both
indices individually was Good. It’s not uncommon for the MINTA most
probable class to be worse that the most probable classes indicated by
either ASPT or NTaxa separately.</p>
<p>Site B The most probable class indicated by ASPT and NTaxa were
different, but MINTA indicated an even worse class. A similar thing
happened here as at Site A, but more extreme. Some of the simulations in
which Bad was indicated by ASPT were different to the simulations in
which Bad was indicated by NTaxa, so when combined, more simulations
were Bad according to MINTA than any other class. At Site A, the
probability of the MINTA class being Good and Moderate are similar, and
at Site B there is little difference in the probabilities of the MINTA
class being poor or bad. This indicates the importance of using the
probabilities of class to make decisions rather than simply the face
value class or even the most probable class.</p>

<p>The first version of RICT was a web application hosted by SEPA. This
version was written in Oracle Express. RICT version 2 (RICT2) was
re-written in R and hosted on Azure ML Studio. Re-writing in R made it
more accessible to researchers and other ecologists to modify and
customise. This also makes the software easier and cheaper to maintain.
RICT version 3 hosted the R code in Github and provide a single web app
replacing what was available on Azure ML Studio .</p>

<p>RICT2 corrected several errors in the original RICT, particularly the
prediction and classification programmes. Because of this, results from
RICT2 differ from those produced by RICT. The following errors were
discovered in RICT and corrected in RICT2:</p>
<p>• RICT inadvertently used the ‘composite families’ version of WHPT
ASPT (i.e. TL2 WHPT Score AbW, CompFam) rather than the ‘distinct
families’ version (TL2 WHPT Score AbW, DistFam), although it did take
account of the additional families included in WHPT. The composite
families are those that were grouped together in the BMWP-score in
compliance with the current taxonomy of the time, outlined in Maitland
(1977), see Appendix A</p>
<p>• RICT did not adjust for sample bias correctly in the calculation of
simulated EQI/EQR values for WHPT ASPT</p>
<p>• RICT suffered from other errors that caused estimates of
probability of class based on WHPT ASPT adjusted for sample bias to
differ from independent estimates even when the error in sample bias
correction was taken into account.</p>
<p>The errors above were reported in Clarke, R.T. &amp; J. Davy-Bowker
(2018) Testing old (2008-18) RICT predictions and classification
uncertainty using independent RIVPACS code and new RIVPACS test data:
Components 1-3. A Report to the Environment Agency. Wareham, Freshwater
Biological Association: pp 84 + preliminaries</p>
<p>• In addition, RICT used an old table of Biologists’ Assessment
Values indicating which of the RIVPACS reference sites complied with WFD
intercalibration screening criteria that caused a slight error in the
conversion factors used to determine EQRs.</p>
<p>Results from RICT2 were checked against independent programmes using
the test data. This provides assurance against errors that previous
versions of RICT did not have.</p>
<p>There is a difference in the way that the probabilities of class are
estimated for multi-year classifications.</p>
<p>Multi-year site assessments in RICT2 are based on averaging the EQR
for each available year, so are just the status class of the average EQR
for the years for which data is available. The proportion of all
simulated multi-year average EQR values falling in each status class
gives us the estimated probability of class. This is not philosophically
correct because we must be less sure about the confidence of class for
the average EQR over several years, but because we do not have any data
for the missing years, we cannot estimate it.</p>
<p>The initial version of RICT used an estimate of the “typical”
(i.e. average) between-year variance within a 3-year period for the
observed values of a WHPT index to allow for 1- or 2-years missing data.
This was also not satisfactory because a site could differ by any amount
within a 3-year period depending on the extent of natural variation,
extreme years and/or anthropogenic related stress. There are three
advantages to the new approach to multi-year classification used in
RICT2:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you do a multi-year site classification based on just one
year, you will get the same probabilities of class as if you had done a
single year classification for the same single year’s data.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of years that can be combined is not limited, whereas
in the original RICT, the maximum was limited to three over a 3-year
period.</p></li>
<li><p>The same approach can be used to determine classifications based
on data from multiple sites.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>RICT version 3 keeps these changes.</p>

<p>The RICT code is available as open-source R package available on
github. If you wish to customise the workflow or run large datasets, it
may be useful to run the code on your local machine. You can download
the <a href="https://github.com/aquaMetrics/rict" class="external-link">package from
Github</a> for this purpose. For contributing to the code, please see <a href="https://github.com/aquaMetrics/rict/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" class="external-link">contributing

<p>Sometimes, the website can fail the first time that you run it.
Before checking anything else, always reload, to see if it runs on a
second attempt. These unexplained failures, possibly caused by a data
transfer drop-out somewhere along the line, are the common causes of app
failing to run.</p>

<p>Once you have entered the data into the Excel (xls) file, the input
file must be saved in CSV (comma delimited) file format only. Other
formats will not be processed by RICT. Other formats may not be able to
be uploaded or the tool may not run.</p>

<p>Any empty lines at the end of the input file may cause RICT to fail.
Ensure the last line of the input file is the last site you have
submitted. Blank lines, or lines of commas may cause RICT to fail.</p>

<p>When using the validation spreadsheet any cells with values
above/below the tolerances/ranges will show as red in the spreadsheet.
These sites may fail the whole run therefore remove these sites from the
input file.</p>

<p>If a site is included in the input file but it is not appearing in
the output file, it is likely that some of the inputted data exceeds the
failure tolerances. Check validations output to see if this is the
case.</p>

<h4 id="grid-reference-errors">Grid Reference Errors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grid-reference-errors"></a>
</h4>
<p>Incorrect grid references are a common cause of problems,
particularly if they are in the sea. RICT uses the grid references to
extract mean air temperature and temperature range from an internal data
file, but the temperature data that RICT uses only covers the land. The
temperature data does not reach as far as the sea, so sites close to the
coast can also fail. If such sites fail, you should use a slightly more
inland grid reference.</p>
<p>Leading zeroes may be omitted because the CSV input file ignores
them, but trailing zeroes must be included. Eastings and northings for
fully numerical grid references (without NGR letters) should not be
used.</p>
