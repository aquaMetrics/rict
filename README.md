## Overview

An R package for calculating River Invertebrate Classification Tool
(RICT) predictions.

# Work in progress

This R package is in development. Please donâ€™t use in production. Please
use the [RICT
website](https://www.fba.org.uk/FBA/Discover-and-Learn/Projects/RIVPACS-RICT/Public/Discover-and-Learn/Projects/RIVPACS-RICT-Landing-Page.aspx?hkey=72b27a8b-d566-4bab-b863-ca39545226ae)
for official documentation and links to the Azure experiments.

## Install

Install [R](rstats.org/install) and we also recommend installing
[Rstudio](rstudio.com/install).

Alternatively, use [R Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) through your
browser.

In the R console, install the development version from GitHub:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("aquaMetrics/rict")
    library(rict)

Open interactive web app:

    rict_app()

Or run the demo dataset through the `rict` function in R to get
classification results:

    results <- rict(demo_observed_values)

Use `rict_predict` to only calculate predictions:

    predictions <- rict_predict(demo_observed_values)

And `rict_classify` to classify these predictions:

    results <- rict_classify(predictions)

See [documentation](https://aquametrics.github.io/rict/) for further
usage details. For example, how to change the default `year_type` from
multi-year to single year classification:

    results <- rict(demo_gis_values_log, year_type = "single")
